# Kotlin Fold Exception Handling

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error scenario in Kotlin's `fold` operation.  The example code throws an exception when the value 3 is encountered during the fold process. This highlights how exceptions within `fold` can prevent the operation from completing and processing the rest of the list.  The solution illustrates a more robust approach to handling such exceptions.

## Bug
The bug is located in `bug.kt`. The `fold` operation throws an `Exception` if the element is 3. This stops the `fold` operation before processing the remaining elements in the list.
